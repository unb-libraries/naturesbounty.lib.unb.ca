    name: Nature's Bounty - Four Centuries of Plant Exploration in New Brunswick
    uri: https://naturesbounty.lib.unb.ca
    description: >
      This study of plant exploration in New Brunswick from 1604 to 2000 is placed 
      firmly within a regional framework. It encompasses short biographical sketches 
      and tells the stories of naturalists and botanists in the light of the times 
      in which they lived. The account illustrates the development of the science of 
      botany and shows how, as museums and learning centres were established in the 
      new land, North Americans became masters in their own house, taking over the 
      botanical enquiry that had previously been the prerogative of Europeans. It 
      examines early ecological studies and curious anomalies of plant distribution, 
      as well as the modern-day emphasis on plant diversity and the need for 
      conservation. It embodies implicit lessons that speak to our present-day 
      concerns with climate change and the environment. Finally, it claims a place 
      for early UNB botanists and for New Brunswick in botanical and environmental historiography.
